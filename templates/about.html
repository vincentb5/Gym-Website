    <p class="info-paragraph">
      I’ve always enjoyed going to the gym and pushing myself to improve, both physically and mentally.
      Training has helped me build discipline, confidence, and consistency, and that mindset carries over
      into everything I do.
    </p>
    <p class="info-paragraph">
      This website was created to share what I’ve learned along the way — from workouts and routines
      to simple guidance that makes training easier to understand. Whether you’re just starting out
      or already lifting, my goal is to keep things straightforward and effective.

  I enjoy going to the gym and challenging myself to get stronger every day.
  Training has taught me discipline and consistency, and this site is a way
  for me to share that passion and help others improve.
