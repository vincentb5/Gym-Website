    <h2 class="info-title">Step 4: Cool-Down & Stretching</h2>
    <p class="info-paragraph">
      Cooling down helps your heart rate gradually return to normal and reduces muscle stiffness after training. Light movement followed by static stretching allows your muscles to relax and recover. Hold each stretch for 20–30 seconds without bouncing, focusing on the muscles you trained. A proper cool-down improves flexibility and supports long-term mobility.
