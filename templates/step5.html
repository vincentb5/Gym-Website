    <p class="info-paragraph">
      Recovery is essential for progress and injury prevention. Muscle growth and strength gains occur when your body repairs itself after workouts. Prioritize quality sleep, stay hydrated, and eat a balanced diet that includes enough protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats. Listening to your body and taking rest days when needed will help you stay consistent and continue improving over time.
