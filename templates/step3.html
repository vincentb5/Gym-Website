    <p class="info-paragraph">
      Cardio training improves heart health, endurance, and overall conditioning. It can include activities like running, cycling, rowing, or high-intensity interval training. Choose a cardio style that aligns with your goals—steady-paced cardio for endurance or HIIT for fat loss and improved athletic performance. Aim for 15–30 minutes depending on your fitness level and recovery needs.
