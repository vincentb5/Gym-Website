    <p class="info-paragraph">
      A proper warm-up prepares your body for exercise by increasing blood flow and loosening your muscles and joints. It helps reduce the risk of injury and improves overall performance. Start with 5–10 minutes of light cardio such as walking, cycling, or jumping rope, followed by dynamic movements like arm circles, leg swings, and hip rotations. Never skip your warm-up, as it sets the foundation for a safe and effective workout.
