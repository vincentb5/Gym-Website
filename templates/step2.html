    <h2 class="info-title">Step 2: Strength Training</h2>
    <p class="info-paragraph">
      Strength training builds muscle, increases bone density, and boosts metabolism. Focus on proper form and controlled movements rather than lifting heavy weights too quickly. Compound exercises such as squats, bench press, rows, and deadlifts are especially effective because they work multiple muscle groups at once. Allow adequate rest between sets and maintain steady breathing throughout each exercise.
